# Mini Web Tailwind

Minimal project for a Static Web using Tailwind-CSS

## Considerations
The project assumes you have installed NPM in your Global

## Some basic explanations
We suppose you know about Tailwind, but still we have add a couple of nice to have in the css/tailwind.css file:

* Basic Tailwind imports
* Shadow text classes (4 classes with different sizes of Text shadows)
* Example of a font import `you-blockhead.ttf` with a new class called `primary-text`
* An example of basic styling of the body to show how to create your own

## Instructions

* Install the project dependencies: `npm i`
* Build the project with: `npm run build`
* Run locally the project with: `npm run start`
